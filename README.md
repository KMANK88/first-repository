## Intro to node

__Node.jsÂ®__ is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

A __node_Module__ is a lego block of code. Everything in a node application is modular, meaning it is made up of many, different smaller parts that work towards the end functionality.


__NPM__ Node package modular- Is a tool that allows us to easily access the node module ecosystem and add them to our project.

Every node app has a __Package.json__ , which is the master file that keeps track of all node modules your project cares about.

To add a `packag.json` to your project `npm init`, and accept all defaults.
